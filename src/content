## CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY APPLICABLE

## TO A

## SUBAWARD ISSUED UNDER A PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES PRIME AWARD

The federal Public Health Service (PHS) has adopted regulations (42 CFR Part 50 Subpart
F and 45 CFR Part 94) on _Promoting Objectivity in Research._ These regulations describe
the actions an individual and an organization must take in order to promote objectivity
in research. The regulations apply to all PHS funded grants, cooperative agreements,
research contracts (but not Phase 1 Small Business Innovation Research or Small
Business Technology Transfer program grants), and subawards where the originating
sponsor is PHS. The regulations require that investigators submitting applications for
funding on behalf of a subrecipient, where the prime sponsor is PHS (e.g., funding from
the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for
Disease Control), prior to the submission of the subaward application to the PHS
Grantee organization^1 , disclose to Auspex Medix LLC any significant financial interests
related to their institutional responsibilities at Auspex Medix LLC.

**Definitions**

**_Institutional responsibilities_** means an Investigator’s professional activities on behalf of
Auspex Medix LLC (e.g., teaching, administration, research or clinical care). Specifically,
these include [Identify those that are applicable to your organization and/or include
others more appropriate]:

- Externally sponsored research or scholarly activities (includes activities such as
    proposing, conducting, and analyzing research and disseminating results);
- Research (includes participation in study sections, peer review of manuscripts, or
    effort on non-sponsored research);

(^1) For purposes of this Policy PHS Grantee is the organization that receives a prime award
directly from PHS and under that prime award the PHS Grantee issues a subaward to a
subrecipient. This policy may also be used for those subawards under a non-PHS
sponsor adopting the PHS _Promoting Objectivity in Research_ regulations.


- Instruction/University Supported Academic activities (including preparation for
    and presentations of formal and informal courses to students/trainee groups,
    mentoring students and trainees, and participation in resident training);
- Clinical Service activities such as performing services for the University’s Faculty
    Practice Plan and affiliated hospitals;
- Administrative activities including serving as Department Chair, Program Director,
    or service on institutional committees, participation in department activities or
    faculty advisory boards, etc.; or
- Special Service activities on behalf of Auspex Medix LLC including institutional
    community service.

**_Investigator_** means the project director or principal Investigator and any other person,
regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of
research funded by a subaward, or proposed for such funding, which may include, for
example, collaborators or consultants. Auspex Medix LLC’s Principal Investigator/Project
Director, upon consideration of the individual’s role and degree of independence in
carrying out the work, will determine who is responsible for the design, conduct, or
reporting of the research.

```
Significant Financial Interest means:
(1) A financial interest consisting of one or more of the following interests of the
Investigator (and those of the Investigator’s spouse and dependent children) that
reasonably appear to be related to the Investigator’s institutional responsibilities on
behalf of Auspex Medix LLC
```
```
(i) With regard to any publicly traded entity , a significant financial interest
exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the
twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any equity
interest in the entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated for the
investigator, investigator’s spouse and dependent children, exceeds
$5,000. For purposes of this definition, remuneration includes salary and
any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g.,
consulting fees, honoraria, paid authorship); equity interest includes any
stock, stock option, or other ownership interest, as determined through
reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market
value;
(ii) With regard to any non-publicly traded entity , a significant financial
interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in
the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds
$5,000, or when the Investigator (or the Investigator’s spouse or
```

```
dependent children) holds any equity interest (e.g., stock, stock option, or
other ownership interest); or
(iii) With regard to intellectual property rights and interest s (e.g., patents,
copyrights), a significant financial interest exists upon receipt of income
of greater than $5,000 related to such rights and interests.
```
```
(iv) Third party reimbursed or sponsored travel (i.e., that which is paid on
behalf of the Investigator and/or the Investigator’s spouse/dependent
children) of greater than $5,000 that is related to the Investigator’s
institutional responsibilities (i.e., administrative, teaching, research, or
clinical activities) must be disclosed to Auspex Medix LLC. The details of
this disclosure will include at a minimum, the purpose of the trip, the
identity of the sponsor/organizer, the destination, and the duration. This
disclosure requirement excludes travel paid for by (Auspex Medix LLC)
and does not apply to travel that is reimbursed or sponsored by an U.S.
federal, state, or local government agency, an U.S. Institution of higher
education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a), an academic teaching hospital,
a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an
Institution of higher education.
```
(2) The term _significant financial interest_ does not include the following types of
financial interests:
(i) Salary, royalties, or other remuneration paid by Auspex Medix LLC to the
Investigator if the Investigator is currently employed or otherwise
appointed by Auspex Medix LLC, including intellectual property rights
assigned to the Auspex Medix LLC and agreements to share in royalties

```
a medical center, or a research institute that is affiliated with an
Institution of higher education.
```
**Disclosure**

Prior to the submission of an application to the PHS Grantee for funding, the Principal
Investigator and all other Investigators at Auspex Medix LLC must have disclosed to
Auspex Medix LLC’s Conflict of Interest Committee (COIC)/designated official an up-to-
date listing of their Significant Financial Interests
[SFIs] (and those of their spouse and dependent children), as defined above. Any new
Investigator, who, subsequent to the submission of an application to the PHS Grantee for
funding from the PHS Grantee, or during the course of the research project, plans to
participate in the project, must similarly disclose their SFI to the COIC/designated official
promptly and prior to participation in the project.

Each Investigator who is participating in research under a subaward where the prime
award originates from PHS must submit an updated disclosure of SFI at least annually,
during the period of the award. Such disclosure must include any information that was
not disclosed initially to Auspex Medix LLC, pursuant to this Policy, or in a subsequent
disclosure of SFI (e.g., any financial conflict of interest identified on a PHSfunded project
directly as a PHS Grantee and/or indirectly through a subaward) that was transferred
from another Institution), and must include updated information regarding any
previously disclosed SFI (e.g., the updated value of a previously disclosed equity
interest).

Each Investigator who is participating in research under a subaward where the prime
award originates from PHS must submit an updated disclosure of SFI (including
reimbursed travel) within thirty (30) days of discovering or acquiring (e.g., through
purchase, marriage, or inheritance) a new SFI.

**Review by Auspex Medix LLC’s COIC/Designated Official**

The COIC/designated official will conduct reviews of disclosures. The COIC/designated
official will review any SFI that has been identified in a disclosure; these interests will be
compared to each research subaward funded under a PHS prime award on which the
Investigator is identified as responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of the
research to determine if the SFI is related to the award and, if so, whether the SFI
creates a Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) related to that research subaward.

**Guidelines for Determining “Relatedness” and Financial Conflict of Interest**


The COIC/designated official will determine whether an Investigator’s SFI is related to
the research under a subaward supported by a PHS prime award and, if so, whether the
SFI is a financial conflict of interest. An Investigator’s SFI is related to the research under
the subaward when the COIC/designated official reasonably determines that the SFI:
could be affected by the research conducted under the subaward; or is in an entity
whose financial interest could be affected by the research. The COIC/designated official
may involve the Investigator in the determination of whether a SFI is related to the
research supported by the subaward.

A financial conflict of interest exists when the COIC/designated official reasonably
determines that the SFI could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or
reporting of the PHS-funded research.

In determining if an Investigator’s SFI is related to the research under a subaward
supported by a PHS prime award, and if so, whether the relationship creates a FCOI, the
COIC/designated official considers the role of the Investigator and the opportunity (if
any), to bias the results, the nature of the research being proposed, and the value of the
SFI in relation to the size and value of the entity. In addition, the COIC/designated
official may also consider the following factors (Your Organization may define others):

1. Whether the research is of a basic or fundamental nature directed at understanding
    basic scientific processes; or
2. Whether the degree of replication and verification of research results is such that
    immediate commercialization or clinical application is not likely; or
3. Whether the goal of the research is to evaluate an invention linked to the SFI (such
    as where the SFI is a patent, or an interest in a company that has licensed the
    invention); or
4. Where the research involves human subjects, whether there are double blind
    conditions or the involvement of a data and safety monitoring board; or
5. Where the SFI is in a privately held company, whether the researcher’s SFI could
    result in the researcher having influence over company decisions, or whether the
    research could have a significant impact on the company’s business or financial
    outlook (excluding Phase I SBIRs and STTRs); or
6. The magnitude of the SFIs (e.g., the amount of consulting, or the percentage or value
    of equity); or
7. Where the SFI is in the sponsor of the research, and the sponsor is a licensee of the
    Discloser’s technology, the amount of commercialization payments received by the
    Investigator from that technology, both currently or in the future; or
8. The number and nature of relationships an Investigator has with an entity. Multiple
    entanglements can create a relationship with an outside entity that is stronger than
    the sum of the parts; or


9. Whether the goal of the research is to validate or invalidate a particular approach or
    methodology that could affect the value of the SFI; or
10. Whether other scientific groups are independently pursuing similar questions; or
11. Whether sufficient external review of the research conducted and the reporting of
    research results exist to mitigate undue bias; or
12. Whether the goal of the project is a comparative evaluation of a technology in which
    an Investigator has a SFI; or
13. Whether the project involves a subaward to an entity in which the Investigator has a
    SFI.

**Management of Significant Financial Interests that Pose Financial Conflict(s) of Interest**

If a conflict of interest exists, the COIC/designated official will determine by what means

- such as the individual’s recusal from decisions affecting the conflicting entity,
abstention from the external activity, modification of the activity, and/or monitoring of
the activity by a subcommittee – the conflict should be avoided or managed in order to
mitigate undue bias. In making those determinations, the COIC/designated official will
be guided by the principles discussed in this Policy the COIC/designated official will also
take into consideration whether the Investigator’s ongoing role is necessary to continue
advancing the research, based upon the factors such as the uniqueness of his or her
expertise and qualifications.

Examples of conditions that might be imposed to manage a financial conflict of interest
include, but are not limited to:

```
a) Public disclosure of financial conflicts of interest (e.g., when presenting or
publishing the research);
b) For research projects involving human subjects research, disclosure of financial
conflicts of interest directly to human participants;
c) Appointment of an independent monitor capable of taking measures to protect
the design, conduct, and reporting of the research against bias resulting from the
financial conflict of interest;
d) Modification of the research plan;
e) Change of personnel or personnel responsibilities, or disqualification of
personnel from participation in all or a portion of the research;
f) Reduction or elimination of the financial interest (e.g., sale of an equity interest);
g) Severance of relationships that create financial conflicts;
h) For research projects involving human subjects research, use of a data and safety
monitoring board;
i) Double-blind conditions;
```

```
j) Provisions to conduct the work simultaneously at multiple sites;
k) Written disclosure of the conflict to all individuals working on the research
project;
l) Annual reports on the research progress to the COIC/designated official.
```
If the COIC/designated official determines that a conflict exists, it will communicate its
determination and the means it has identified for eliminating or managing the conflict,
in writing, to the individual, to the relevant Principal Investigator/Project Director, and
the appropriate direct supervisor. The COIC/designated official will keep a record of the
disclosure and other relevant information for at least three years. If the
COIC/designated official prescribes monitoring of the activity, it will describe what
monitoring shall be performed and what records are to be kept.

No expenditures on a subaward supported by a PHS prime award will be permitted until
the Investigator has complied with the Disclosure requirements of this Policy and has
agreed, in writing, to comply with any plans determined by the COIC/designated official
necessary to manage the Conflict of Interest. The COIC/designated official will
communicate, in writing, with the PHS Grantee to notify it of the existence and the
nature of a Financial Conflict of Interest and whether the conflict has been managed,
reduced, or eliminated. No expenditures can be incurred until the PHS Grantee has
reported the FCOI to PHS. The PHS Grantee will notify Auspex Medix LLC when it may
incur expenditures.

The COIC/designated official will keep a record of Investigator disclosures of financial
interests and the COIC/designated official’s review of, and response to, such disclosure
and all actions under this policy. Such records will be maintained and kept for at least
three years from the date the final expenditures report is submitted and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the subaward and relevant PHS Regulations.

**Public Accessibility to Information Related to Financial Conflicts of Interest**

Prior to the expenditure of any funds under a subaward funded by a PHS prime award,
Auspex Medix LLC will ensure public accessibility, via a publicly accessible Web site or by
written response to any requestor within five business days of a request, of information
concerning any SFI disclosed that meets the following three criteria:

```
(i) The Significant Financial Interest was disclosed and is still held by the
senior/key personnel. Senior/key personnel are the PD/PI and any other
person identified as senior key personnel by Auspex Medix LLC in the
subaward application to the PHS Grantee, progress report or any other report
submitted to the PHS Grantee;
```

```
(ii) Auspex Medix LLC has determined that the Significant Financial Interest is
related to the research funded through a subaward; and
```
```
(iii) Auspex Medix LLC has determined that the Significant Financial Interest is a
financial conflict of interest.
```
The information that Auspex Medix LLC will make available via a publicly accessible Web
site or in a written response to any requestor within five days of request will include, at a
minimum, the following:

```
(i) The Investigator’s name;
(ii) The Investigator’s title and role with respect to the research project;
(iii) The name of the entity in which the Significant Financial Interest is held;
(iv) The nature of the Significant Financial Interest; and
(v) The approximate dollar value of the Significant Financial Interest in the
following ranges: $0-$4,999; $5,000-9,999; $10,000 - $19,999; amounts
between $20,000-$100,000 by increments of $20,000; amounts above
$100,000 by increments of $50,000), or a statement that the interest is one
whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices
or other reasonable measures of fair market value.
```
If Auspex Medix LLC uses a publicly accessible Web site to comply with the public
disclosure requirements of the PHS regulations, the information posted will be updated
at least annually, and within sixty days of receipt or identification of information
concerning any additional Significant Financial Interest of the senior/key personnel for
the PHS-funded research project that had not been previously disclosed, or upon the
disclosure of a Significant Financial Interest of senior/key personnel new to the PHS-
funded research project, if it is determined by the COIC/designated official that the
Significant Financial Interest is related to the research and is a financial conflict of
interest.

If Auspex Medix LLC responds to written requests for the purposes of public accessibility,
it will ascertain from the Investigator that the information provided is current as of the
date of the correspondence, and will note in its written response that the information is
subject to updates, on at least an annual basis and within 60 days of the Auspex Medix
LLC’s identification of a new financial conflict of interest, which should be requested
subsequently by the requestor.


Information concerning the Significant Financial Interests of an individual, as limited by
this Policy, will remain available, for responses to written requests or for posting via
Auspex Medix LLC’s publicly accessible Web site for at least three years from the date
that the information was most recently updated.

**Reporting of Financial Conflicts of Interest**

Prior to the expenditure of any funds under a subaward funded by a PHS prime award,
Auspex Medix LLC will provide to the PHS Grantee a FCOI report compliant with PHS
regulations regarding any Investigator’s Significant Financial Interest found to be
conflicting and will ensure that the Investigator has agreed to and implemented the
corresponding management plan. Auspex Medix LLC cannot incur expenditures until it
has received notification to do so from the PHS Grantee.

While the subaward is ongoing (including any extensions with or without funds), Auspex
Medix LLC will provide to the PHS Grantee an annual FCOI report that addresses the
status of the FCOI and any changes in the management plan.

For any Significant Financial Interest that is identified as conflicting subsequent to an
initial FCOI report during an ongoing PHS-funded research project (e.g., upon the
participation of an Investigator who is new to the research project), Auspex Medix LLC
will provide to the PHS Grantee, within forty five days, an FCOI report regarding the
financial conflict of interest and ensure that Auspex Medix LLC has implemented a
management plan and the Investigator has agreed to the relevant management plan.

**Training Requirements**

Each Investigator must complete training on _Auspex Medix LLC Conflict of Interest Policy
Applicable to A Subaward Issued Under A Public Health Services Prime Award_ prior to
engaging in research related to any PHS-funded subaward and at least every four years,
and immediately (as defined below) when any of the following circumstances apply:

```
1) Auspex Medix LLC revises this Policy, or procedures related to this Policy, in any
manner that affects the requirements of Investigators (training is to be completed
within the timeframe specified in communications announcing such changes);
2) An Investigator is new to Auspex Medix LLC research under a subaward issued under
a PHS prime award (training is to be completed prior to his/her participation in the
research); or
```

```
3) Auspex Medix LLC finds that an Investigator is not in compliance with this Policy or a
management plan issued under this Policy (training is to be completed within 30
days in the manner specified by the COIC/designated official).
```
```
In fulfillment of the training requirement, Auspex Medix LLC requires its investigators to
complete the National Institutes of Health’s Financial Conflict of Interest tutorial located at:
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coi/tutorial2011/fcoi.htm in accordance with the
requirements and expectations of this Policy. All investigators must print a certification of
completion at the end of training and retain it for audit purposes. Note: Your Organization can
develop and/or consider other compliant training opportunities.
```
**Failure to Comply with Auspex Medix LLC’s Conflict of Interest Policy Applicable to
Public Health Service Funded Subaward**

When a FCOI is not identified or managed in a timely manner, including, for example,
because the underlying Significant Financial Interest is not disclosed timely by an
Investigator or, because a FCOI was not timely reviewed or reported by a second tier
subrecipient or by Auspex Medix LLC; or because an investigator failed to comply with a
management plan; then Auspex Medix LLC will within
90 days:

```
a) Complete a retrospective review of the Investigator’s activities and the research
project to determine any bias in the design, conduct or reporting of research; b)
Document the retrospective review consistent with the regulation;
c) Document Auspex Medix LLC’s determination as to whether any research, or
portion thereof, conducted during the period of time of the Investigator’s non-
compliance with this Policy or a Financial Conflict of Interest management plan, was
biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of such research; and d) Notify the PHS
Grantee in writing.
```
If bias is found, Auspex Medix LLC shall notify the PHS Grantee promptly and submit a
mitigation report to the PHS Grantee that shall address the following:

- Impact of the bias on the research project and
- Auspex Medix LLC’s plan of action or actions taken to eliminate or mitigate the
    effect of the bias.

Thereafter, Auspex Medix LLC shall submit FCOI reports annually to the PHS Grantee, in
accordance with the regulation and terms and conditions of the subaward agreement.
Depending on the nature of the Financial Conflict of Interest, Auspex Medix LLC may
determine that additional interim measures are necessary with regard to the
Investigator’s participation in the research project between the date that the Financial


```
Conflict of Interest is identified and the completion of Auspex Medix LLC’s independent
retrospective review.
```
**Clinical Research**

If the PHS Grantee determines that one of its funded clinical research projects whose
purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device or treatment
has been designed, conducted or reported by an Investigator with a Financial Conflict of
Interest that was not managed or reported by Auspex Medix LLC, shall require the
Investigator involved to disclose the Financial Conflict of Interest in each public
presentation of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously
published presentations.

**Failure to Comply with This Policy**
No expenditures of funds on a subaward supported by a PHS prime award will be
permitted unless the Investigator has complied with the Disclosure requirements of this
Policy and has agreed, in writing, to comply with any COIC/designated official-approved
FCOI management plan.

Any failure by an individual to adhere to this Policy may be cause for disciplinary action,
including, in severe cases, termination, and termination of the subaward by the PHS
Grantee.

**Disclaimer:** Each subrecipient is legally required to independently assess the adequacy
of its COI policy for purposes of compliance with legal requirements, including
compliance with the PHS financial conflict of interest regulations, and with other federal,
state, local and institutional requirements. This model policy is provided as a tool to
assist in drafting the subrecipient’s own policy. No representation is made that this
model policy complies with any organization’s particular legal requirements. Prior to
finalizing or implementing this Policy, consult with appropriate legal counsel to
determine its legal sufficiency.
